### Streamlining the FAIR Metrics Evaluation Process for Researchers.

In the contemporary scientific landscape, the emphasis on applying and evaluating the FAIR principles on Digital Objects (DO) has gained significant traction. As academics globally rally towards achieving FAIRness, representing these efforts, especially in the realm of Recognition & Rewards, remains abstract.

Existing automated FAIR metrics evaluation tools like FAIR enough, the FAIR evaluator, and FAIRsFAIR's F-UJI have been pivotal in the Open Science movement. Digital Competence Centers have further augmented this by facilitating activities ranging from awareness campaigns to targeted training.

Yet, the actual use of FAIR metrics evaluation tools by the average researcher is marred by intricacies and a steep learning curve. This repository aims to bridge this gap, making FAIR evaluations more accessible, and seamlessly integrating them into the researcher's profiles.

## Features:

- User-friendly fetching of FAIR evaluations via the FAIR Enough API.
- Analyze FAIR evaluations from local JSON files.
- Intuitive representation of key FAIR metrics and comments.
