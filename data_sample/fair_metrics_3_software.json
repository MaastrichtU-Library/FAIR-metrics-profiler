Below is a summary of the main changes: New Features and Improvements: <strong>Revamped CSS for Better Text Wrapping and Responsive Layout (#43):</strong> The extension's styles have been updated for better text wrapping and responsive layout, providing a more consistent and pleasant user experience. <strong>Optimized and Debugged contentScript.js and background.js Scripts:</strong> The scripts have been refined for enhanced performance and compatibility. This optimization makes the DOI detection more efficient. <strong>UI Feedback for API Calls:</strong> A loading spinner has been added to the extension's interface. This spinner appears when the extension is evaluating a DOI, providing a visual cue to the users that the process is underway. <strong>Adjusted Font Size for Evaluation Results:</strong> The font size of the FAIR evaluation results displayed in the extension popup has been reduced, making the results easier to read and more consistent with the overall style of the extension. Bug Fixes: <strong>Fixed XMLHttpRequest in popup.js:</strong> Removed the <code>require</code> function, which is not supported natively in browsers and wasn't needed for creating an XMLHttpRequest in the current context. <strong>Fixed Popup Console Error:</strong> An issue that prevented the popup console from logging errors correctly has been resolved. <strong>popup.js Updated to Use DOMContentLoaded Event:</strong> The <code>getDoi</code> function now waits for the full DOM to load before running, preventing potential timing issues. <strong>Addressed Crashing Websites Issue (#42):</strong> Fixed a bug that caused some websites to crash when the extension was used. Other Updates: The extension now uses the year and version information from the <code>package.json</code> file. The highlight color for detected DOIs has been adjusted for better visibility.

Below is a summary of the main changes:\n\nNew Features and Improvements:\n\nRevamped CSS for Better Text Wrapping and Responsive Layout (#43): The extension's styles have been updated for better text wrapping and responsive layout, providing a more consistent and pleasant user experience.\nOptimized and Debugged contentScript.js and background.js Scripts: The scripts have been refined for enhanced performance and compatibility. This optimization makes the DOI detection more efficient.\nUI Feedback for API Calls: A loading spinner has been added to the extension's interface. This spinner appears when the extension is evaluating a DOI, providing a visual cue to the users that the process is underway.\nAdjusted Font Size for Evaluation Results: The font size of the FAIR evaluation results displayed in the extension popup has been reduced, making the results easier to read and more consistent with the overall style of the extension.\n\nBug Fixes:\n\nFixed XMLHttpRequest in popup.js: Removed the require function, which is not supported natively in browsers and wasn't needed for creating an XMLHttpRequest in the current context.\nFixed Popup Console Error: An issue that prevented the popup console from logging errors correctly has been resolved.\npopup.js Updated to Use DOMContentLoaded Event: The getDoi function now waits for the full DOM to load before running, preventing potential timing issues.\nAddressed Crashing Websites Issue (#42): Fixed a bug that caused some websites to crash when the extension was used.\n\nOther Updates:\n\nThe extension now uses the year and version information from the package.json file.\nThe highlight color for detected DOIs has been adjusted for better visibility.\n\nFor more details about the changes and improvements in this release, check the closed issues on our GitHub page.

Below is a summary of the main changes: New Features and Improvements: Revamped CSS for Better Text Wrapping and Responsive Layout (#43): The extension's styles have been updated for better text wrapping and responsive layout, providing a more consistent and pleasant user experience. Optimized and Debugged contentScript.js and background.js Scripts: The scripts have been refined for enhanced performance and compatibility. This optimization makes the DOI detection more efficient. UI Feedback for API Calls: A loading spinner has been added to the extension's interface. This spinner appears when the extension is evaluating a DOI, providing a visual cue to the users that the process is underway. Adjusted Font Size for Evaluation Results: The font size of the FAIR evaluation results displayed in the extension popup has been reduced, making the results easier to read and more consistent with the overall style of the extension. Bug Fixes: Fixed XMLHttpRequest in popup.js: Removed the require function, which is not supported natively in browsers and wasn't needed for creating an XMLHttpRequest in the current context. Fixed Popup Console Error: An issue that prevented the popup console from logging errors correctly has been resolved. popup.js Updated to Use DOMContentLoaded Event: The getDoi function now waits for the full DOM to load before running, preventing potential timing issues. Addressed Crashing Websites Issue (#42): Fixed a bug that caused some websites to crash when the extension was used. Other Updates: The extension now uses the year and version information from the package.json file. The highlight color for detected DOIs has been adjusted for better visibility.

Below is a summary of the main changes: New Features and Improvements: Revamped CSS for Better Text Wrapping and Responsive Layout (#43): The extension's styles have been updated for better text wrapping and responsive layout, providing a more consistent and pleasant user experience. Optimized and Debugged contentScript.js and background.js Scripts: The scripts have been refined for enhanced performance and compatibility. This optimization makes the DOI detection more efficient. UI Feedback for API Calls: A loading spinner has been added to the extension's interface. This spinner appears when the extension is evaluating a DOI, providing a visual cue to the users that the process is underway. Adjusted Font Size for Evaluation Results: The font size of the FAIR evaluation results displayed in the extension popup has been reduced, making the results easier to read and more consistent with the overall style of the extension. Bug Fixes: Fixed XMLHttpRequest in popup.js: Removed the require function, which is not supported natively in browsers and wasn't needed for creating an XMLHttpRequest in the current context. Fixed Popup Console Error: An issue that prevented the popup console from logging errors correctly has been resolved. popup.js Updated to Use DOMContentLoaded Event: The getDoi function now waits for the full DOM to load before running, preventing potential timing issues. Addressed Crashing Websites Issue (#42): Fixed a bug that caused some websites to crash when the extension was used. Other Updates: The extension now uses the year and version information from the package.json file. The highlight color for detected DOIs has been adjusted for better visibility.

Below is a summary of the main changes: New Features and Improvements: Revamped CSS for Better Text Wrapping and Responsive Layout (#43): The extension's styles have been updated for better text wrapping and responsive layout, providing a more consistent and pleasant user experience. Optimized and Debugged contentScript.js and background.js Scripts: The scripts have been refined for enhanced performance and compatibility. This optimization makes the DOI detection more efficient. UI Feedback for API Calls: A loading spinner has been added to the extension's interface. This spinner appears when the extension is evaluating a DOI, providing a visual cue to the users that the process is underway. Adjusted Font Size for Evaluation Results: The font size of the FAIR evaluation results displayed in the extension popup has been reduced, making the results easier to read and more consistent with the overall style of the extension. Bug Fixes: Fixed XMLHttpRequest in popup.js: Removed the require function, which is not supported natively in browsers and wasn't needed for creating an XMLHttpRequest in the current context. Fixed Popup Console Error: An issue that prevented the popup console from logging errors correctly has been resolved. popup.js Updated to Use DOMContentLoaded Event: The getDoi function now waits for the full DOM to load before running, preventing potential timing issues. Addressed Crashing Websites Issue (#42): Fixed a bug that caused some websites to crash when the extension was used. Other Updates: The extension now uses the year and version information from the package.json file. The highlight color for detected DOIs has been adjusted for better visibility.

Below is a summary of the main changes: New Features and Improvements: Revamped CSS for Better Text Wrapping and Responsive Layout (#43): The extension's styles have been updated for better text wrapping and responsive layout, providing a more consistent and pleasant user experience. Optimized and Debugged contentScript.js and background.js Scripts: The scripts have been refined for enhanced performance and compatibility. This optimization makes the DOI detection more efficient. UI Feedback for API Calls: A loading spinner has been added to the extension's interface. This spinner appears when the extension is evaluating a DOI, providing a visual cue to the users that the process is underway. Adjusted Font Size for Evaluation Results: The font size of the FAIR evaluation results displayed in the extension popup has been reduced, making the results easier to read and more consistent with the overall style of the extension. Bug Fixes: Fixed XMLHttpRequest in popup.js: Removed the require function, which is not supported natively in browsers and wasn't needed for creating an XMLHttpRequest in the current context. Fixed Popup Console Error: An issue that prevented the popup console from logging errors correctly has been resolved. popup.js Updated to Use DOMContentLoaded Event: The getDoi function now waits for the full DOM to load before running, preventing potential timing issues. Addressed Crashing Websites Issue (#42): Fixed a bug that caused some websites to crash when the extension was used. Other Updates: The extension now uses the year and version information from the package.json file. The highlight color for detected DOIs has been adjusted for better visibility.

                                        "The FAIR Extension v1.1.0 Release Notes This release brings several key updates and improvements to the FAIR extension, focusing on performance optimization, user experience enhancements, and bug fixes. Below is a summary of the main changes: New Features and Improvements: Revamped CSS for Better Text Wrapping and Responsive Layout (#43): The extension's styles have been updated for better text wrapping and responsive layout, providing a more consistent and pleasant user experience. Optimized and Debugged contentScript.js and background.js Scripts: The scripts have been refined for enhanced performance and compatibility. This optimization makes the DOI detection more efficient. UI Feedback for API Calls: A loading spinner has been added to the extension's interface. This spinner appears when the extension is evaluating a DOI, providing a visual cue to the users that the process is underway. Adjusted Font Size for Evaluation Results: The font size of the FAIR evaluation results displayed in the extension popup has been reduced, making the results easier to read and more consistent with the overall style of the extension. Bug Fixes: Fixed XMLHttpRequest in popup.js: Removed the require function, which is not supported natively in browsers and wasn't needed for creating an XMLHttpRequest in the current context. Fixed Popup Console Error: An issue that prevented the popup console from logging errors correctly has been resolved. popup.js Updated to Use DOMContentLoaded Event: The getDoi function now waits for the full DOM to load before running, preventing potential timing issues. Addressed Crashing Websites Issue (#42): Fixed a bug that caused some websites to crash when the extension was used. Other Updates: The extension now uses the year and version information from the package.json file. The highlight color for detected DOIs has been adjusted for better visibility.

Below is a summary of the main changes: New Features and Improvements: Revamped CSS for Better Text Wrapping and Responsive Layout (#43): The extension's styles have been updated for better text wrapping and responsive layout, providing a more consistent and pleasant user experience. Optimized and Debugged contentScript.js and background.js Scripts: The scripts have been refined for enhanced performance and compatibility. This optimization makes the DOI detection more efficient. UI Feedback for API Calls: A loading spinner has been added to the extension's interface. This spinner appears when the extension is evaluating a DOI, providing a visual cue to the users that the process is underway. Adjusted Font Size for Evaluation Results: The font size of the FAIR evaluation results displayed in the extension popup has been reduced, making the results easier to read and more consistent with the overall style of the extension. Bug Fixes: Fixed XMLHttpRequest in popup.js: Removed the require function, which is not supported natively in browsers and wasn't needed for creating an XMLHttpRequest in the current context. Fixed Popup Console Error: An issue that prevented the popup console from logging errors correctly has been resolved. popup.js Updated to Use DOMContentLoaded Event: The getDoi function now waits for the full DOM to load before running, preventing potential timing issues. Addressed Crashing Websites Issue (#42): Fixed a bug that caused some websites to crash when the extension was used. Other Updates: The extension now uses the year and version information from the package.json file. The highlight color for detected DOIs has been adjusted for better visibility.

Below is a summary of the main changes:\n\nNew Features and Improvements:\n\nRevamped CSS for Better Text Wrapping and Responsive Layout (#43): The extension's styles have been updated for better text wrapping and responsive layout, providing a more consistent and pleasant user experience.\nOptimized and Debugged contentScript.js and background.js Scripts: The scripts have been refined for enhanced performance and compatibility. This optimization makes the DOI detection more efficient.\nUI Feedback for API Calls: A loading spinner has been added to the extension's interface. This spinner appears when the extension is evaluating a DOI, providing a visual cue to the users that the process is underway.\nAdjusted Font Size for Evaluation Results: The font size of the FAIR evaluation results displayed in the extension popup has been reduced, making the results easier to read and more consistent with the overall style of the extension.\n\nBug Fixes:\n\nFixed XMLHttpRequest in popup.js: Removed the require function, which is not supported natively in browsers and wasn't needed for creating an XMLHttpRequest in the current context.\nFixed Popup Console Error: An issue that prevented the popup console from logging errors correctly has been resolved.\npopup.js Updated to Use DOMContentLoaded Event: The getDoi function now waits for the full DOM to load before running, preventing potential timing issues.\nAddressed Crashing Websites Issue (#42): Fixed a bug that caused some websites to crash when the extension was used.\n\nOther Updates:\n\nThe extension now uses the year and version information from the package.json file.\nThe highlight color for detected DOIs has been adjusted for better visibility.\n\nFor more details about the changes and improvements in this release, check the closed issues on our GitHub page.

Optimized and Debugged contentScript.js and background.js Scripts: The scripts have been refined for enhanced performance and compatibility. This optimization makes the DOI detection more efficient. UI Feedback for API Calls: A loading spinner has been added to the extension's interface. This spinner appears when the extension is evaluating a DOI, providing a visual cue to the users that the process is underway. Adjusted Font Size for Evaluation Results: The font size of the FAIR evaluation results displayed in the extension popup has been reduced, making the results easier to read and more consistent with the overall style of the extension. Bug Fixes: Fixed XMLHttpRequest in popup.js: Removed the require function, which is not supported natively in browsers and wasn't needed for creating an XMLHttpRequest in the current context. Fixed Popup Console Error: An issue that prevented the popup console from logging errors correctly has been resolved. popup.js Updated to Use DOMContentLoaded Event: The getDoi function now waits for the full DOM to load before running, preventing potential timing issues. Addressed Crashing Websites Issue (#42): Fixed a bug that caused some websites to crash when the extension was used. Other Updates: The extension now uses the year and version information from the package.json file. The highlight color for detected DOIs has been adjusted for better visibility.

Below is a summary of the main changes: New Features and Improvements: Revamped CSS for Better Text Wrapping and Responsive Layout (#43): The extension's styles have been updated for better text wrapping and responsive layout, providing a more consistent and pleasant user experience. Optimized and Debugged contentScript.js and background.js Scripts: The scripts have been refined for enhanced performance and compatibility. This optimization makes the DOI detection more efficient. UI Feedback for API Calls: A loading spinner has been added to the extension's interface. This spinner appears when the extension is evaluating a DOI, providing a visual cue to the users that the process is underway. Adjusted Font Size for Evaluation Results: The font size of the FAIR evaluation results displayed in the extension popup has been reduced, making the results easier to read and more consistent with the overall style of the extension. Bug Fixes: Fixed XMLHttpRequest in popup.js: Removed the require function, which is not supported natively in browsers and wasn't needed for creating an XMLHttpRequest in the current context. Fixed Popup Console Error: An issue that prevented the popup console from logging errors correctly has been resolved. popup.js Updated to Use DOMContentLoaded Event: The getDoi function now waits for the full DOM to load before running, preventing potential timing issues. Addressed Crashing Websites Issue (#42): Fixed a bug that caused some websites to crash when the extension was used. Other Updates: The extension now uses the year and version information from the package.json file. The highlight color for detected DOIs has been adjusted for better visibility.

Below is a summary of the main changes: New Features and Improvements: Revamped CSS for Better Text Wrapping and Responsive Layout (#43): The extension's styles have been updated for better text wrapping and responsive layout, providing a more consistent and pleasant user experience. Optimized and Debugged contentScript.js and background.js Scripts: The scripts have been refined for enhanced performance and compatibility. This optimization makes the DOI detection more efficient. UI Feedback for API Calls: A loading spinner has been added to the extension's interface. This spinner appears when the extension is evaluating a DOI, providing a visual cue to the users that the process is underway. Adjusted Font Size for Evaluation Results: The font size of the FAIR evaluation results displayed in the extension popup has been reduced, making the results easier to read and more consistent with the overall style of the extension. Bug Fixes: Fixed XMLHttpRequest in popup.js: Removed the require function, which is not supported natively in browsers and wasn't needed for creating an XMLHttpRequest in the current context. Fixed Popup Console Error: An issue that prevented the popup console from logging errors correctly has been resolved. popup.js Updated to Use DOMContentLoaded Event: The getDoi function now waits for the full DOM to load before running, preventing potential timing issues. Addressed Crashing Websites Issue (#42): Fixed a bug that caused some websites to crash when the extension was used. Other Updates: The extension now uses the year and version information from the package.json file. The highlight color for detected DOIs has been adjusted for better visibility.

Addressed Crashing Websites Issue (#42): Fixed a bug that caused some websites to crash when the extension was used. Other Updates: The extension now uses the year and version information from the package.json file. The highlight color for detected DOIs has been adjusted for better visibility.

Below is a summary of the main changes: New Features and Improvements: Revamped CSS for Better Text Wrapping and Responsive Layout (#43): The extension's styles have been updated for better text wrapping and responsive layout, providing a more consistent and pleasant user experience. Optimized and Debugged contentScript.js and background.js Scripts: The scripts have been refined for enhanced performance and compatibility. This optimization makes the DOI detection more efficient. UI Feedback for API Calls: A loading spinner has been added to the extension's interface. This spinner appears when the extension is evaluating a DOI, providing a visual cue to the users that the process is underway. Adjusted Font Size for Evaluation Results: The font size of the FAIR evaluation results displayed in the extension popup has been reduced, making the results easier to read and more consistent with the overall style of the extension. Bug Fixes: Fixed XMLHttpRequest in popup.js: Removed the require function, which is not supported natively in browsers and wasn't needed for creating an XMLHttpRequest in the current context. Fixed Popup Console Error: An issue that prevented the popup console from logging errors correctly has been resolved. popup.js Updated to Use DOMContentLoaded Event: The getDoi function now waits for the full DOM to load before running, preventing potential timing issues. Addressed Crashing Websites Issue (#42): Fixed a bug that caused some websites to crash when the extension was used. Other Updates: The extension now uses the year and version information from the package.json file. The highlight color for detected DOIs has been adjusted for better visibility.
